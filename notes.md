## Animals

"And around them, mingled with them, above their heads and below their feet,
more faces and more limbs: a man and a woman clutching each other by the hair,
two asps sucking the eyes of one of the damned, a grinning man whose hooked
hands parted the maw of a hydra, and all the animals of Satan’s bestiary,
assembled in a consistory and set as guard and crown of the throne that faced
them, singing its glory in their defeat, fauns, beings of double sex, brutes
with six- fingered hands, sirens, hippocentaurs, gorgons, harpies, incubi,
dragopods, minotaurs, lynxes, pards, chimeras, cynophales who darted fire from
their nostrils, crocodiles, polycaudate, hairy serpents, salamanders, horned
vipers, tortoises, snakes, two-headed creatures whose backs were armed with
teeth, hyenas, otters, crows, hydrophora with saw-tooth horns, frogs, gryphons,
monkeys, dog-heads, leucrota, manticores, vultures, paranders, weasels,
dragons, hoopoes, owls, basilisks, hypnales, presters, spectafici, scorpions,
saurians, whales, scitales, amphisbenae, iaculi, dipsases, green lizards, pilot
fish, octopi, morays, and sea turtles. The whole population of the nether world
seemed to have gathered to act as vestibule, dark forest, desperate wasteland
of exclusion, at the apparition of the Seated One in the tympanum, at his face
promising and threatening, they, the defeated of Armageddon, facing Him who
will come at last to separate the quick from the dead."

"The other pages, on the contrary, were already finished, and as we looked at
them, neither I nor William could suppress a cry of wonder. This was a psalter
in whose margins was delineated a world reversed with respect to the one to
which our senses have accustomed us. As if at the border of a discourse that is
by definition the discourse of truth, there proceeded, closely linked to it,
through wondrous allusions in aenigmate, a discourse of falsehood on a
topsy-turvy universe, in which dogs flee before the hare, and deer hunt the
lion. Little bird-feet heads,, animals with human hands on their back, hirsute
pates from which feet sprout, zebra-striped dragons, quadrupeds with serpentine
necks twisted in a thousand inextricable knots, monkeys with stags’ horns,
sirens in the form of fowl with membranous wins, armless men with other human
bodies emerging from their backs like humps, and figures with tooth-filled
mouths on the belly, humans with horses’ heads, and horses with human legs,
fish with birds’ wings and birds with fishtails, monsters with single bodies
and double heads or single heads and double bodies, cows with cocks’ tails and
butterfly wings, women with heads scaly as a fish’s back, two-headed chimeras
interlaced with dragonflies with lizard snouts, centaurs, dragons, elephants,
manticores stretched out on tree branches, gryphons whose tails turned into an
archer in battle array, diabolical creatures with endless necks, sequences of
anthropomorphic animals and zoomorphic dwarfs joined, sometimes on the same
page, with scenes of rustic life in which you saw, depicted with such
impressive vivacity that the figures seemed alive, all the life of the fields,
plowmen, fruit gatherers, harvesters, spinning-women, sowers alongside foxes,
and martens armed with crossbows who were scaling the walls of a towered city
defended by monkeys. Here an initial letter, bent into an L, in the lower part
generated a dragon; there a great V, which began the word “verba,” produced as
a natural shoot from its trunk a serpent with a thousand coils, which in turn
begot other serpents as leaves and clusters."
